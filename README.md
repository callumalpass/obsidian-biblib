# BibLib for Obsidian

BibLib is a streamlined approach to academic reference management that leverages Obsidian's core strengths: plain text, interlinked notes, and powerful metadata. Unlike plugins that focus on Zotero integration, BibLib enables you to manage your entire reference library directly within Obsidian, eliminating synchronization complexities and giving you a fully integrated knowledge system.

## Why BibLib?

Most reference management solutions for Obsidian focus on integrating with external tools like Zotero. While powerful, this approach creates overheadâ€”keeping two separate libraries in sync, handling format conversions, and maintaining complex workflows.

BibLib takes a different approach:

- **Plain text first**: Your entire reference library lives in markdown files with YAML frontmatter that closely mirrors CSL-JSON structure.
- **Fully integrated**: References become first-class citizens in your knowledge graph, linkable and queryable like any other note.
- **Frictionless capture**: Automatic metadata retrieval through Citoid and CrossRef APIs removes the pain of manual entry.
- **Seamless annotation**: Leverage Obsidian's native PDF annotation capabilities to create precise citations like `[[paper.pdf#page=1&selection=17,1,21,22|Smith 2023, p. 1]]` directly within your notes.
- **Pandoc-compatible**: Since your references use CSL-compatible structure, they work seamlessly with pandoc citations and bibliographies.
- **No external dependencies**: Everything stays in your vault, with no reliance on third-party applications.

This approach has proven effective for my personal academic workflow for several years, offering the perfect balance of simplicity and power. When combined with plugins like [PDF++](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus), BibLib creates a comprehensive environment for managing both reference metadata and annotations in a unified, interlinked system.

## How to Use

### Creating Literature Notes

1. Open the command palette and select "Create Literature Note"
2. Enter the bibliographic information in the modal:
   - **Auto-fill option**: Enter a DOI, URL, or ISBN and click "Lookup" to automatically fill the form
   - Required fields: Citekey, Type, Title, Year
   - Optional fields depend on the publication type
3. Add contributors (authors, editors, etc.)
4. Choose an attachment option:
   - No attachment
   - Import file (copies PDF/EPUB to your configured attachment folder)
   - Link to existing file (creates a link to a file already in your vault)
5. Click "Create Note" to generate a formatted literature note

### Creating Book Chapter Entries

1. There are two ways to create a chapter entry:
   - Open the command palette and select "Create Book Chapter Entry"
   - While viewing a book entry, open the command palette and select "Create Chapter From Current Book"
2. Enter the chapter information:
   - Required fields: Citekey, Title, Container Book, Year
   - The container book dropdown shows all book entries in your vault
3. When you select a container book, relevant information is automatically inherited:
   - Publisher and publisher place
   - Book editors (mapped as container-authors)
   - Publication year
   - Book's attachment (as a link option)
4. Add chapter-specific information:
   - Chapter author(s)
   - Page range
   - Chapter-specific metadata
5. Choose an attachment option:
   - No attachment
   - Import a new file
   - Link to an existing file (the container book's PDF is suggested if available)
6. Click "Create Chapter Note" to generate a formatted chapter note

### Building a Bibliography

1. Create literature notes for your references using the method above
2. Open the command palette and select "Build Bibliography"
3. The plugin will:
   - Generate a `citekeylist.md` file with all citation keys
   - Create a comprehensive `bibliography.json` file with full citation data
4. These files can be used with external tools or referenced in your notes

### Working with PDF Annotations

BibLib seamlessly integrates with Obsidian's native PDF capabilities, creating a powerful workflow for academic reading and citation:

1. Attach PDFs to your literature notes during creation
2. Open PDFs directly from your literature notes
3. Create precise annotations using Obsidian's PDF viewer
4. Insert citations in your notes using Obsidian's annotation syntax:
   ```
   [[smith2023.pdf#page=42&selection=17,1,21,22|Smith 2023, p. 42]]
   ```
5. Enhance your PDF workflow with compatible plugins like [PDF++](https://github.com/RyotaUshio/obsidian-pdf-plus)

This workflow keeps your references, PDFs, and annotations all within the same system, creating a truly integrated research environment.

## Settings

### File Paths
- **Attachment folder path**: Where PDF and EPUB attachments will be stored
- **Create subfolder for attachments**: Option to create a subfolder for each citation
- **Literature note location**: Where literature notes will be stored
- **Use prefix for literature notes**: Option to add a prefix to literature note filenames
- **Literature note prefix**: The prefix to add to literature note filenames

### API Settings
- **Citoid API URL**: The URL for the Citoid API to fetch bibliographic data (default uses Wikipedia's Citoid API, with CrossRef API fallback for DOIs)

### Custom Frontmatter Fields
- **Include date created**: Add a dateCreated field with creation timestamp
- **Include year field**: Add a separate year field for easy filtering
- **Include author links**: Add authorLink field with Obsidian links to author pages
- **Include attachment links**: Add attachment field with Obsidian links to attached files

### Note Templates
- **Header Template**: Customize the format of the first header in literature notes using variables:
  - `{{title}}` - The title of the reference
  - `{{citekey}}` - The citation key
  - `{{year}}` - Publication year
  - `{{authors}}` - Formatted author names
  - `{{pdflink}}` - Link to the attached PDF (if available)
  - Supports conditional blocks with `{{^variable}}fallback{{/variable}}`
- **Chapter Header Template**: Customize the format of the first header in chapter notes with additional variables:
  - `{{container-title}}` - The title of the container book

### Bibliography Builder
- **Bibliography JSON path**: Where to save the bibliography.json file
- **Citekey list path**: Where to save the citekeylist.md file


## Upcoming Features

- Bulk import of existing bibliographic data from BibTeX/CSL-JSON

## Important Note About Obsidian's YAML Parser

Obsidian's frontmatter parser only supports simple key-value pairs and does not handle nested objects in YAML. When using this plugin, you may see warnings in Obsidian for certain fields that BibLib generates (particularly the `authors` and `issued` fields). 

Please note that these warnings do not indicate a problem - the YAML generated by BibLib is completely valid and can be properly converted to CSL-JSON for use with tools like Pandoc. Obsidian simply cannot display or utilize the nested structure of these fields in its metadata views.
