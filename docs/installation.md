3.  Go into the `plugins` sub-directory.

5.  Copy the downloaded `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` files into the `biblib` folder.

## Installation via BRAT

BRAT is an Obsidian plugin that helps install and update plugins that are not yet in the official community store.

    *   Go to `Settings` -> `Community plugins` -> `Browse`.
    *   Search for "BRAT" and install it.
    *   Enable the BRAT plugin in the `Community plugins` list.
2.  **Add BibLib Beta:**
    *   Open the BRAT settings (`Settings` -> `Community Plugins` -> `Obsidian42 - BRAT`).
    *   Click on the `Add Beta plugin` button.
    *   Enter the GitHub repository path for BibLib: `callumalpass/obsidian-biblib`.
    *   Click `Add Plugin`. BRAT will download and install BibLib.
3.  **Enable BibLib:**
    *   Go back to `Settings` -> `Community plugins`.
    *   Find "BibLib" and toggle it **on**.

BRAT will also help you keep BibLib updated automatically as new beta versions are released.
